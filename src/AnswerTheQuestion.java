Answer the questions:
Given bracket sequence: [((())()(())]]
Can this sequence be considered correct?
If the answer to the previous question is “no”, then what needs to be changed in it to make it correct?

/*
Answer:
No. Given bracket sequence is incorrect.
There are two symbols that do not have a pair  ( and ].
Bracket should be used in pairs. Left parenthesis should have right parenthesis. The same for square brackets
In order to fix sequence we need to delete this two symbols.
Correct sequence: [(())()(())]
